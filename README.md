# Shiver Me Timbers Bot
## About
A discord bot that will monitor for a link to a 4chan webm, go to the link, download it, and reupload to the server in which it was posted in order to archive the content. 4chan threads eventually die and, as a result, webm links posted in the server are broken and the webm is lost.

This bot will store the webms on the discord server in a text channel called "webm-archive", which it will create automatically, if a text channel with that name does not already exist, when it is added to your server.

## Name
The name "Shiver Me Timbers" comes from a video created by Varli Singh. I can't find the original video on her platform, but here's a link to a post on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/TikTokCringe/comments/nby4fb/humpty_dumpty/) showing the video. It's super strange and was the main motivation to make this bot after stumbling upon it on a 4chan thread.
