# Shiver Me Timbers Bot
## About
A discord bot that will monitor for a link to a 4chan webm, go to the link, download it, and reupload to the server in which it was posted in order to archive the content. 4chan threads eventually die and, as a result, webm links posted in the server are broken and the webm is lost. This bot will store the webms on the discord server in a text channel called "webm-archive", which it will create automatically, if a text channel with that name does not already exist, when it is added to your server.
